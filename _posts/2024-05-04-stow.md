# What is Stow ?

`GNU Stow` helps you backup your Dotfiles (configuration files). So when you "stow" a file, it will create a `symlink` between your file and an identical file in our home directory.


## Installation

```bash
brew list git # check if git is installed
brew list stow # check if stow is installed
cd ~
mkdir dotfiles # Create a directory to store dotfiles
```

## Usage

### Add a dotfile
This works for both hidden file and folder

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
mkdir ~/dotfiles/zsh # create folder
mv ~/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/zsh # move dotfile into dotfile folder
stow zsh # create a symlink
ls -ld ~/.zshrc # check for new symlink
```

### GIT version Control
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Manage nvim config with stow"
git push # upload local repository content to remote repository
```

### Restore folders from git

- This shows how to restore folders from git using stow on a fresh machine
- **note**: delete the existing files before running the command (ie. `rm ~/.zshrc` )

```bash
git clone your-repository-url ~/dotfiles # download
cd ~/dotfiles
stow folder-name  # Replace 'folder-name' with the name of the folder containing your config files, e.g., zsh, oh-my-zsh, etc.
```

### Clean up Symlinks from home directory (untested)
```bash
stow -D folder-name # Remove symlink
```

## List of User configuration files for backup

* `.zshrc `- Zsh configurations (file).
* `.oh-my-zsh` - Configuration for Oh My Zsh (directory).
* `.gitconfig` - Global Git configuration settings (file).
*  `.vimrc` - Configuration for Vim (file).

## üîÅ Regular Daily Syncing (No Force)

Use this routine daily on **either machine** to avoid conflicts and stay consistent:

### Before making changes:

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles
git pull origin main
```

### After making changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
```

### On the other machine:

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles
git pull origin main
```

## üîß One-Time Conflict Fix: Force Sync Two Machines

Use this **only when one machine (A) has the correct version**, and the other (B) should be reset to match it.

### On Machine A (the source of truth):

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles
git add .
git commit -m "Ensure local changes are up to date"
git push origin main --force
```

### On Machine B (the one being reset):

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

(Optional but recommended)

### On Machine A again (to verify sync):

```sh
git pull origin main
```
