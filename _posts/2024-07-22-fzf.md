## What is FZF ?

fzf is a general-purpose fuzzy finding program for your terminal that can be used to search through text or the outputs of other programs, and by default, it will search for all the files on your machine if you just type fzf.

## Shell Configuration

```bash
# Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completions
[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.fzf.zsh
source ./.zshrc
```

## What can it do ?

### Use the `preview` option with fzf to preview the files that you're searching for

```bash
fzf --preview="cat {}"

fzf --preview="bat --color=always {}" # Doesn't work
```

### Use fzf to `open` your search results in a program like neovim

```bash
nvim $(fzf --preview="bat --color=always {}")
```

### Select multiple files using the `m` argument

```bash
nvim $(fzf -m --preview="bat --color=always {}") #TAB to select multiple files

:tab all #view all files in separate tabs
```

### Create an alias for your fzf command to easily search and open files in neovim.

```bash
# Alias for FZF NeoVIM Setup
alias inv='nvim $(fzf -m --preview="bat --color=always {}")'
# Tip ! Run alias within a folder for less files to filter
```

### Autocomplete when you CD into a directory. (Doesn't Work)

#### is this from terminal or from fzf window ?

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles/**
```

### Kill processes by searching for them in a fuzzy findable way

```bash
# regular way
ps -eaf | grep postgres # get the PID
kill -9

# fzf way
kill -9 ** # see list of processes
postgres # click process to delete
```

### Unalias aliases in your zshrc file

```bash
unalias ** # choose from list
```
