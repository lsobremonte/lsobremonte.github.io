# Summary
Simplified representations of how the world works. They help us understand complex things and make better decisions.

### Simplify Complexities
- `80/20 rule: `80% of results come from 20% of efforts.
- `Theory of constraints: `Identify and address the main bottleneck to improve the system.
- `First principles: `Break down complex problems into basic, foundational elements.
- `Occam's razor: `The simplest explanation is usually the best.
- `Hock principle: `Seek simplicity on the other side of complexity.

### Reveal Counterintuitive Insights
- `Interest-based counting: `Track progress by engagement and impact, not just numbers.
- `Via negativa: `Focus on reducing negatives rather than adding positives.
- `Inversion: `Solve problems by thinking about what to avoid or do the opposite.
- `Relativity: `Understand things in relation to others rather than in isolation.
- `Velocity vs speed: `Velocity includes direction, speed does not.

### More Mental Models

`Map is not the territory: `This model teaches us that a map is not the same thing as the real world. Maps are simplifications and can be misleading.

`Circle of competence:` This model teaches us to focus on the areas where we have knowledge and expertise. We should avoid making decisions outside of our circle of competence.

`First- vs. second-order thinking:` First-order thinking is about considering only the immediate consequences of our actions. Second-order thinking is about considering the long-term consequences of our actions.

`Probabilistic thinking:` This model teaches us to think about the likelihood of events happening. We should not think in terms of absolutes.

`Inversion: `This model teaches us to approach problems by thinking about what failure would look like. Then, we can take steps to avoid those failures.

`Occam's razor: `This principle states that simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complex explanations.

`Hanlon's razor: `This principle states that we should not attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence.

`Reciprocity: `This principle states that people are more likely to treat us well if we treat them well.

`Activation energy: `This model is from chemistry, but it can be applied to our lives as well. It tells us that we need a certain amount of energy to get started on a task. We can use catalysts to lower our activation energy and make it easier to get started.
