# Summary
Simplified representations of how the world works. They help us understand complex things to make better **decisions** and **problem solving**.

### Simplify Complexities
- **80/20 rule:** 80% of results come from 20% of efforts.

- **Theory of constraints:** Identify and address the main bottleneck to improve the system.

- **First principles:** Break down complex problems into basic, foundational elements.

- **Occam's razor:** The simplest explanation is usually the best.

- **Hick's Law:** The more choices you have, the longer it takes to make a decision.

### Reveal Counterintuitive Insights
- **Interest-based counting:** The goal is to find common ground and create solutions that are win-win rather than win-lose.

- **Via negativa:** Focus on reducing negatives rather than adding positives.

- **Inversion:** Solve problems by thinking about what to avoid or do the opposite.

- **Relativity:** considering multiple perspectives beyond your own to develop more comprehensive and effective solutions.

- **Velocity vs speed:** velocity represents progress toward a specific goal while speed is just the rate of movement.

### General 

- **Map is not the territory:** This model teaches us that a map is not the same thing as the real world. Maps are simplifications and can be misleading.

- **Circle of competence:** This model teaches us to focus on the areas where we have knowledge and expertise. We should avoid making decisions outside of our circle of competence.

- **First- vs. second-order thinking:** First-order thinking is about considering only the immediate consequences of our actions. Second-order thinking is about considering the long-term consequences of our actions.

- **Probabilistic thinking:** This model teaches us to think about the likelihood of events happening. We should not think in terms of absolutes.

- **Inversion:** This model teaches us to approach problems by thinking about what failure would look like. Then, we can take steps to avoid those failures.

- **Occam's razor:** This principle states that simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complex explanations.

- **Hanlon's razor:** This principle states that we should not attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence.

- **Reciprocity:** This principle states that people are more likely to treat us well if we treat them well.

- **Activation energy:** This model is from chemistry, but it can be applied to our lives as well. It tells us that we need a certain amount of energy to get started on a task. We can use catalysts to lower our activation energy and make it easier to get started.

### Learning
- **Problem solving is search:** Our brains solve problems by searching through a problem space, like a maze. This space contains all the possible solutions, and we need to find the one that leads to the desired outcome. The more complex the problem, the larger the search space and the harder it is to find the solution.

- **Memory strengthens by retrieval:** Retrieving information from memory strengthens the memory more than just seeing it again. Testing yourself on what you learned is a great way to improve your memory and solidify the information in your brain.

- **Knowledge grows exponentially:** The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. This is because new information can be connected to existing knowledge, making it easier to remember and understand.

- **Creativity is mostly copying:** Creativity is often seen as coming up with entirely new ideas, but it's actually more about combining existing ideas in new ways. New inventions are usually based on old ideas that have been modified or improved.

- **Skills are specific, transfer is limited:** Learning one skill can improve your ability to learn other similar skills, but it won't necessarily help you learn completely unrelated skills. This is because skills are specific to the knowledge and methods used.

- **Mental bandwidth is extremely limited:** We can only focus on a few things at a time. This means that it's important to prioritize the information that we pay attention to, as irrelevant information can slow down learning.

- **Success is the best teacher:** We learn more from success than failure. This is because success tells us what works, while failure only tells us what doesn't work. Aim for an 85% success rate in your learning by adjusting the difficulty of the material you practice.

- **We reason through examples:** We often reason by constructing mental models of situations. For example, when solving a logic problem, we might imagine a scenario that matches the problem and see if the conclusion follows. This can lead to mistakes if we don't consider all possible scenarios.

- **Knowledge becomes invisible with experience:** As we practice a skill, it becomes more automated and requires less conscious thought. This can make it difficult to teach the skill to others, as we may not be aware of all the steps involved.

- **Relearning is relatively fast:** It's usually much faster to relearn something you've forgotten than to learn it for the first time. This is because some of the knowledge is still there, and it just needs a little boost to be recalled.
