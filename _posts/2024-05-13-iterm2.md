## Troubleshooting

### Issue - Why does my terminal have question marks ?

Explanation:   Insecure folder error
[Zsh detects insecure completion-dependent directories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61433167/zsh-detects-insecure-completion-dependent-directories)
Fix:

```bash
chmod 755 /usr/local/share/zsh
chmod 755 /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
```

### Error - Insecure Folders

```bash
[oh-my-zsh] Insecure completion-dependent directories detected:
drwxrwxr-x  3 lsobremonte  admin   96 12 Dec  2020 /usr/local/share/zsh
drwxrwxr-x  5 lsobremonte  admin  160  7 Mar 21:37 /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
[oh-my-zsh] For safety, we will not load completions from these directories until
[oh-my-zsh] you fix their permissions and ownership and restart zsh.
[oh-my-zsh] See the above list for directories with group or other writability.
[oh-my-zsh] To fix your permissions you can do so by disabling
[oh-my-zsh] the write permission of "group" and "others" and making sure that the
[oh-my-zsh] owner of these directories is either root or your current user.
[oh-my-zsh] The following command may help:
[oh-my-zsh]     compaudit | xargs chmod g-w,o-w
[oh-my-zsh] If the above didn't help or you want to skip the verification of
[oh-my-zsh] insecure directories you can set the variable ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX to
[oh-my-zsh] "true" before oh-my-zsh is sourced in your zshrc file.
```

### Issue - Why does my VSCode terminal have different colours and bolded text which doesn’t match iterm2 colours ?

FIX:
It’s because your VSCode setting

```bash
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "zsh",
```

Is referencing your ./zshrc file and referencing

```bash
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

Try a different theme like ‘robbyrussell’ (default oh my zsh theme).
